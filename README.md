## Hi!
I'm Jonah, a recent computer science graduate from UCLA interested in civic tech and transportation research 🏙️ 🚌 🚄 🚠 

### Right now
🚦I'm a Student Professional Worker at the [Los Angeles Department of Transportation](https://ladot.lacity.gov/) working on data science projects for the Advanced Transportation Systems and Research section (ATSAR)

🧬 I also contribute to projects helping bioinformatics researchers as a full stack software engineering intern at [CleverCanary](https://www.clevercanary.com/)!  

### Current projects
🚲 I'm working on a study of how multimodal usage of bikeshare can help give more people access to opportunity, based on a case study in Detroit. I also presented work related to this at the Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting! (repo currently on private, will be public soon!)

🥼 I contribute to the [Data Browser](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/data-browser) at Clever Canary, a configurable web based to give researchers access to scientific data~

### Past Projects
:turtle: I was the project manager for [Pen Pals](https://github.com/uclaacm/pen-pals), an educational website to teach middle and elementary school students Python! I worked on this with a team of students in UCLA's ACM TeachLA

🅿️ I contributed to [ParkSmart](https://github.com/jpaten/parksmart) as part of my UCLA Capstone project, a proof of concept website to create more efficient parking markets!
